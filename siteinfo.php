			In October, 1976 the co-executors of Hannah Arendt's estate, Lotte Kohler and Mary McCarthy, delivered a collection of reel-to-reel audio tapes of Heinrich Blücher's lectures given at The New School and at Bard, along with transcriptions of some of the audio tapes, to Fred Cook, the Librarian at the time. Many of the transcriptions were made by Alexander Bazelow ('71); some appear to have been made by Ruth Schulz.

			Maurice York ('00) is largely responsible for getting the first site up and running. He designed the pages, wrote the introduction, & scanned hundreds of pages of text. He was assisted by Robyn Carliss ('02) and Katherine Happ ('01).
		</p>
		<p>
			Alexander Bazelow ('71) re-discovered these materials on the web after 30 years, inspired the development of a commencement conference in May, 2003 and contributed its <a href="http://www.hannaharendt.net/reports/bluecher.html" target="_blank">keynote address</a>. His support continues to be vital to our endeavor to keep these materials available and useful.
		</p>
		<p>
			Summaries and keyword/descriptors were contributed by Elliot Dutcher ('08).
		</p>
		<p>
			Our plans for the site include: 1) digitizing all remaining text related to the lectures; 2) converting analog audio tapes into digital files for posting on the site; 3) developing a virtual space for continuing the conversation begun by Heinrich Blücher 52 years ago.
